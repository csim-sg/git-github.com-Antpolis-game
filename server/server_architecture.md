# Server Architecture

**Description:** This document outlines the architecture of the game server, including the different components and their interactions.

**1. Technology Stack:**

*   Backend: Node.js
*   Framework: Express.js
*   Websockets: Socket.IO
*   Database: MongoDB or PostgreSQL
*   Language: TypeScript

**2. Components:**

*   **API Server:** Handles REST API requests for user authentication, game state, and other non-real-time data.
*   **Websocket Server:** Handles real-time communication between clients and the server for game updates.
*   **Game Logic:** Implements the core game logic, including move validation, game state updates, and win/loss conditions.
*   **Database:** Stores game data, including user profiles, troop information, zone ownership, and resource levels.
*   **Zone Manager:** Manages the game world, including zone properties, resource distribution, and AI behavior.
*   **Quest Manager:** Manages quests, including quest assignment, progress tracking, and reward distribution.
*   **Trading System:** Implements the trading logic and auction house functionality.
*   **Leaderboard System:** Tracks player progress and maintains leaderboards.

**3. Data Flow:**

1.  Client sends a move to the server via websocket.
2.  Server validates the move using the game logic.
3.  If the move is valid, the server updates the game state in memory and in the database.
4.  Server sends a game update to all relevant clients via websocket.
5.  Client receives the game update and renders the changes.

**4. Scalability:**

*   Use a load balancer to distribute traffic across multiple server instances.
*   Use a message queue (e.g., RabbitMQ or Kafka) for asynchronous tasks.
*   Use a caching layer (e.g., Redis or Memcached) to improve performance.
