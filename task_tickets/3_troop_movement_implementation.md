# Task Ticket: Troop Movement Implementation (Client-Side)

**Description:** Implement troop movement and animations in Phaser.

**Goal:** To enable troops to move around the tile-based map, allowing players to strategically position their units.

**Rationale:** Troop movement is a core mechanic of the game, allowing players to interact with the game world and engage in combat.

**Tasks:**

*   Create a new file `src/objects/Troop.ts` for the Troop class.
*   Create `Sprite` objects for troops in `Troop.ts`.
*   Load troop images (e.g., `troop.png`) into Phaser's cache.
*   Create animations for different troop states (idle, walking, attacking) using Phaser's animation API.
*   Implement input handling for troop selection and movement in `GameScene.ts`.
*   Implement A\* pathfinding algorithm (or use a library) to calculate the path between two tiles.
*   Implement client-side movement animation using Phaser's tweens.
*   Create troop sprites in the chosen art style.

**Subtasks:**

*   Create a `Troop` class that extends `Phaser.GameObjects.Sprite`.
*   Load troop images using `this.load.spritesheet()`.
*   Create animations using `this.anims.create()`.
*   Implement input handling for troop selection using `this.input.on('pointerdown', ...)`.
*   Implement A\* pathfinding using a library like EasyStar.js or Pathfinding.js.
*   Move the troop sprite along the calculated path using `this.tweens.add()`.

**Dependencies:**

*   Tile-based Map Implementation

**Notes:**

*   Refer to the Phaser documentation for sprites and animations.
*   Consider using a pathfinding library for A\* implementation.
