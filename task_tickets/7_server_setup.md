# Task Ticket: Server Setup

**Description:** Set up the Node.js server with Express.js and Socket.IO.

**Goal:** To create a basic server that can handle API requests and websocket connections for the game.

**Rationale:** The server is responsible for managing the game state, handling user authentication, and facilitating real-time communication between clients.

**Tasks:**

*   Set up Node.js, Express.js, and Socket.IO.
*   Implement basic API endpoints (e.g., user authentication, get game state, submit move).
*   Set up database connection (MongoDB or PostgreSQL).
*   Implement websocket handling for real-time game updates.
*   Implement game logic for validating moves and updating game state.
*   Implement zone management and resource distribution.
*   Implement quest management and reward distribution.
*   Implement trading logic and auction house functionality.
*   Implement leaderboard tracking and ranking.

**Subtasks:**

*   Create a new Node.js project: `npm init -y`
*   Install Express.js: `npm install express`
*   Install Socket.IO: `npm install socket.io`
*   Create a basic Express.js server.
*   Implement API endpoints for user authentication (e.g., `/register`, `/login`).
*   Connect to a database (MongoDB or PostgreSQL).
*   Implement middleware for authentication and authorization.
*   Implement data models for users, troops, zones, resources, etc.
*   Implement functions for validating user input and preventing cheating.

**Dependencies:**

*   Node.js
*   npm

**Notes:**

*   Use a framework like Passport.js for user authentication.
*   Consider using an ORM like Sequelize or Mongoose for database interaction.
*   Use a message queue (e.g., RabbitMQ or Kafka) for asynchronous tasks.
