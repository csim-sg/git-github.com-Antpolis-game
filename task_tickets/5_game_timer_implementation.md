# Task Ticket: Game Timer Implementation (Client-Side)

**Description:** Implement the game timer in Phaser.

**Goal:** To display a countdown timer that indicates the remaining time in the game.

**Rationale:** The game timer provides a sense of urgency and limits the duration of each match.

**Tasks:**

*   Create a `Text` object in `GameScene.ts` to display the timer.
*   Implement timer formatting to convert seconds to minutes and seconds.
*   Update the `Text` object with the remaining time every second.
*   Implement visual feedback for low time (e.g., change timer color).
*   Design timer UI in the chosen art style.

**Subtasks:**

*   Create a `Text` object using `this.add.text()`.
*   Implement a function to format the remaining time in minutes and seconds.
*   Update the `Text` object with the formatted time every second using `this.time.addEvent()`.
*   Implement visual feedback for low time by changing the text color or adding an animation.

**Dependencies:**

*   Phaser Project Setup

**Notes:**

*   Use Phaser's `Time` object to manage the game timer.
*   Consider adding a countdown sound effect when the timer is low.
