# Task Ticket: Phaser Project Setup

**Description:** Set up the Phaser project with TypeScript and Webpack.

**Goal:** To create a basic project structure that allows for the development of a Phaser game using TypeScript and Webpack.

**Rationale:** This is the foundational step for the entire client-side development. A well-structured project will improve code maintainability and scalability.

**Tasks:**

*   Create a new directory for the Phaser project: `mkdir client`
*   Navigate to the client directory: `cd client`
*   Initialize a new npm project: `npm init -y`
*   Install Phaser: `npm install phaser`
*   Install TypeScript: `npm install typescript --save-dev`
*   Install Webpack and its dependencies: `npm install webpack webpack-cli webpack-dev-server ts-loader --save-dev`
*   Create a `tsconfig.json` file with appropriate compiler options.
*   Create a `webpack.config.js` file to configure Webpack.
*   Create an `index.html` file to load the game.
*   Create a `src` directory for the game source code.
*   Find placeholder assets for testing in the chosen art style.

**Subtasks:**

*   Configure TypeScript compiler options.
*   Configure Webpack to bundle the Phaser project.
*   Create a basic HTML file to load the game.

**Dependencies:**

*   Node.js
*   npm

**Notes:**

*   Refer to the Phaser documentation for project setup instructions.
*   Use a TypeScript starter template for Phaser if available.
