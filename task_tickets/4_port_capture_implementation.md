# Task Ticket: Port Capture Implementation (Client-Side)

**Description:** Implement port capture mechanics in Phaser.

**Goal:** To allow players to capture ports by deploying troops, creating a strategic objective for the game.

**Rationale:** Port capture is the primary win condition of the game. Implementing this mechanic allows players to achieve victory.

**Tasks:**

*   Create a new file `src/objects/Port.ts` for the Port class.
*   Create `Sprite` or `Graphics` objects for ports in `Port.ts`.
*   Implement capture progress indicator using Phaser's `Graphics` object.
*   Implement input handling for troop deployment to ports in `GameScene.ts`.
*   Implement visual feedback for capture progress (e.g., change port color, add animation).
*   Create port sprites in the chosen art style.

**Subtasks:**

*   Create a `Port` class that extends `Phaser.GameObjects.Sprite` or `Phaser.GameObjects.Graphics`.
*   Implement a method to handle troop deployment to the port.
*   Implement a method to update the capture progress based on the number of troops deployed.
*   Implement visual feedback for capture progress using Phaser's `Graphics` object or animations.

**Dependencies:**

*   Troop Movement Implementation

**Notes:**

*   Consider using a state machine to manage the port's capture state (e.g., idle, capturing, captured).
*   Use Phaser's tweens to create smooth animations for the capture progress indicator.
